# A vanilla js calculator

## This is another calculator like many others except the following features:
1. Allow multiple operands and operations in calculation
2. The calculation will execute only when calc button is clicked
3. Calculate with respect to mathematical operation order

Some features to add in the future:
1. add +/- button to handle negative numbers
2. add brackets
3. some more advanced math operations

have fun calculating :-)
