# Calculator
built with vanilla js as a part of "The Odin Project" curriculum

## This is another calculator like many others except the following features:
1. Allow multiple operands and operations in calculation
2. The calculation will execute only when calc button is clicked
3. Calculate with respect to mathematical operation order

[try it on github pages](https://aviyacg.github.io/calculator/), have fun calculating :-)
